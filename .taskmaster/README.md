## Risk Assessment

### High Impact Risks

1. **OpenAI API rate limits or costs exceed budget**
   - *Mitigation*: Aggressive caching, consider alternative models for non-critical tasks

2. **Web scraping blocked by school websites**
   - *Mitigation*: Rotating proxies, respectful rate limiting, fallback to manual entry

### Medium Impact Risks

3. **AI response time > 5 seconds under load**
   - *Mitigation*: Optimize prompts, streaming responses, faster models

4. **Free tier abuse (excessive usage)**
   - *Mitigation*: Strict rate limiting, IP tracking, CAPTCHA on signup

5. **Payment integration complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Well-documented Stripe integration, extra testing time

## Task Format

Each task in `tasks.json` includes:

```json
{
  "id": "TRACK-###",
  "title": "Task name",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "priority": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "status": "pending|in_progress|completed|blocked",
  "estimated_hours": 0,
  "dependencies": ["OTHER-TASK-ID"],
  "subtasks": ["Specific action items"]
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Review** `tasks.json` for complete task details
2. **Identify** tasks with no dependencies (can start immediately)
3. **Assign** tasks to team members based on expertise
4. **Track** progress by updating task status in `tasks.json`
5. **Update** estimated hours as work progresses

## User Stories Mapping

All tasks map back to user stories defined in the PRD:

- **ST-101**: User account creation → AUTH-002
- **ST-102**: Secure login → AUTH-003
- **ST-103**: Prompt input → DRAFT-001
- **ST-104**: Draft upload → DRAFT-002
- **ST-105**: AI feedback → AI-003
- **ST-106**: Draft saving → DRAFT-004, DRAFT-005
- **ST-107**: School selection → SCHOOL-004, FE-006
- **ST-108**: Essay customization → AI-005
- **ST-109**: School data storage → SCHOOL-006
- **ST-110**: Tier restrictions → TIER-003, FE-007
- **ST-111**: Version control → DRAFT-003

## Success Criteria

### MVP Launch Readiness
- [ ] All critical priority tasks completed
- [ ] Core user flows tested end-to-end
- [ ] Free and paid tiers functional
- [ ] Security hardening complete
- [ ] Performance targets met (< 5s AI response)
- [ ] System stable under 5000 user load
- [ ] Payment processing operational
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts active

### Post-Launch Goals
- 8-12% free-to-paid conversion rate
- < 5 second average AI response time
- 99.9% uptime
- Support 5000+ monthly active users

## Notes

- Tasks are designed to be **1-2 day efforts** maximum (2-10 hours)
- Complex features are broken into **multiple subtasks**
- **Parallel tracks** minimize cross-team blocking
- Focus on **MVP scope** - advanced features deferred to post-launch
- **School knowledge auto-pull** is the key differentiator
