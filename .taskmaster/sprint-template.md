## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy** a sprint section for each week
2. **Update** task IDs from tasks.json
3. **Assign** tasks based on team skills
4. **Commit** to 70-80% of capacity (buffer for unknowns)
5. **Track** daily progress in standup section
6. **Review** in retrospective at sprint end
7. **Adjust** next sprint based on velocity

## Tips for Success

- âœ“ Start each sprint with clear, measurable goals
- âœ“ Break down tasks > 8 hours into subtasks
- âœ“ Have daily check-ins (even async)
- âœ“ Don't overcommit - leave buffer time
- âœ“ Celebrate wins in retrospectives
- âœ“ Learn from blockers and adjust
- âœ“ Keep tasks visible and update status daily
